                  What Acmeism is (and isn't) About
     
     * Acmeism is about People getting together
         regardless of their language
     * Acmeism is *not* about converting people to your language
     * Acmeism is about sharing great ideas
     * Acmeism is *not* about stealing great ideas...
       * Unless you give them back!
     
     This is a module that Miyagawa-san stole from the Beatles...
